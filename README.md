# About CSU Booking Platform

A tool to improve location and equipment reservation workflow for clubs, students and faculty members.

_You must have the ZenHub Extension installed for your browser to properly our issue board and sprints._

## Installation

### Hard Requirements
- Some web server: `Apache` / `Nginx` / `Caddy`
- `Postgres` > 12
- `PHP` >= 7.4
- PHP extensions you might not have by default: `bcmath, pgsql`
- [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [node and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- `xdebug` is always a plus

_Use any XAMPP/ MAMP like tools, I recommended `laragon` on win or `valet`/`valet+` on mac_

### First-Time Setup Steps
1. once you clone the repo run `composer fresh`, it will run a batch of the starter commands.
1. Open the `.env` and configure it to work with what you need, _namely the DB connection_
1. Create a database matching the connection details in your `.env`
1. Create the db schema and seed it with random values with `composer mfs`
1. verify your setup is functional with `php artisan self-diagnosis`
1. Access the app through your preferred local web server setup
   _(I like valet+ on macs & laragon on win... ghetto way: php artisan serve with sqlite db)_

### Bonus Commands
- When you see DB issues run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` (`composer mfs` for short) to quickly recreate the db tables and seed it with random data
- If you just need more random data in the db run `php artisan db:seed`
- When everything goes to hell run `composer fresh` or `composer reset` if you think its related to composer dependencies
- `npm run dev` or `npm run watch` for frontend dev build, the watch command will recompile when files are changed

### Docs for all the things

- [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)

## Usage

### Website
Navigate to your local site. Varies depending on web server. Could be localhost:8000, could be csu.test ðŸ¤·

### API
Look at `routes/api.php` file for a quick view of api specific routes that are defined for this application.
[Postman](https://www.postman.com) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) are good tools for building 
out api endpoint collections.

### Console
Tinker is the primary tool for testing queries, php logic, and debugging weird code... Basically your best friend.
Open it with `php artisan tinker`. It's an interactive repl php shell that makes it quick & easy to dumbass proof your code.

## Testing

### PHPUnit
Yu can run `php artisan test` to run all the test suites.
Normally your IDE can be configured to run specific tests or all of them. Refer to specific IDE documentation.

### Jest
Again, your IDE should recognize these tests and help you create a run configuration for those. To run everything from console use `npm run test`.

### Debugging
For PHP, make sure your install the XDebug PHP extension and configure it properly. I like to use remote autostart to avoid hassle and quickly debug my code.
